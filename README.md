# Image to ascii art converter
This Java program converts an image to ascii art.



## **How it worksðŸ¤“**
- Loop through every pixel in the image
- Get the RGB values of the pixel
- Convert the RGB into brightness
- Match the brightness with an ascii character
- Write to an output text file

## **TODO**
- [x] Generate ascii art from image
- [x] save to an output file
- [x] Double the width of the ascii
- [x] Also use box drawing characters
- [x] Put it in a GUI where you can upload the image and save to clipboard
